# LogicalAudio Plugin Suite

**LogicalAudio** is a suite of experimental synthesis modules for **VCV Rack 2**, focused on the intersection of audio processing, propositional logic, and random voltage generation.

Each module is designed as a creative tool for modular synthesists, composers, and sound designers interested in pushing the boundaries of logical structures within a modular audio environment.
