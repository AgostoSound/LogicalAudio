![Captura de pantalla 2025-05-24 160544](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f728405-d7d0-40fd-b048-7e79d37d517b)

**L-Carrier** is a logic gate audio carrier module that processes two control voltage inputs (A and B) and an audio input. It outputs audio signals routed through various logic gate conditions: AND, OR, XOR, NAND, NOR and XNOR, with visual feedback through LEDs indicating gate states.

## üîß Functionality Overview

- The module reads two logic control voltages (A IN and B IN) and an audio input.
- Logic HIGH is defined as exactly 10V on the A or B inputs; any other voltage is considered LOW.
- Outputs route the audio input through gates corresponding to basic logical operations:
  - **AND**: Audio passes only if both A and B are HIGH.
  - **NAND**: Audio passes if NOT(AND) condition is met.
  - **OR**: Audio passes if either A or B is HIGH.
  - **NOR**: Audio passes if neither A nor B is HIGH.
  - **XOR**: Audio passes if exactly one of A or B is HIGH.
  - **XNOR**: Audio passes if both A and B are equal (both HIGH or both LOW).
- Corresponding LEDs illuminate to indicate active logic states for inputs and XOR condition.
- When a logic condition is not met, its paired output is muted (0V).

## üí° Creative Uses

- Use as a dynamic audio gate controlled by logic CV inputs.
- Combine with clock or trigger signals to create complex rhythmic gating patterns.
- Apply logic-based audio routing for creative patching and modulation.
- Visual feedback LEDs help monitor logic states live during performance.
